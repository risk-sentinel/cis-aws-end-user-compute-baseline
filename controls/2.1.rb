    To allow users to administer Amazon WorkSpaces, IAM policies must be created and attached with the required permissions to an IAM Principal used for administration of Amazon WorkSpaces.  An IAM Principal may be a IAM Role or an IAM User, or an IAM User Group with Users within the User Group.

    AWS has an AWS Managed Policy, `AmazonWorkSpacesAdmin` that grants permissions to administer Amazon WorkSpaces.  A custom managed policy or inline policy may be used to grant WorkSpaces permissions to the IAM Principal

    Creating and managing Workspaces specific users is not done in AWS IAM.  Creating and managing Workspaces specific users is done within the Workspace service console.  In order to properly administer Workspaces specific users, an IAM Principal with proper permissions must be created.

    Perform the following to determine what policies are created and how the policies are used:

    From the Console:

    1. Login in and open the IAM console at `https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/`.

    2. In the left pane click on `User Groups`, `Users`, or `Roles`.  

    3. Click on the IAM Principal (User, Group, or Role) that is to be used to administer Workspaces.
 
    4. Click on `Permissions` and confirm that the AmazonWorkSpacesAdmin policy or the proper permissions are attached.

    From the Command Line:

    1. Run the appropriate command to determine permissions for the IAM Principal.  
     such as `list-attached-role-policies` for attached managed policies or `get-role-policy` for inline policies.  
    ```
    aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name ```

    If the AWS managed policy or a custom WorkSpaces Admin policy is not attached to the IAM Principal for administration of Workspaces, refer to the remediation below.

    7. Click `Attach Policy`
	
    From the Command Line:

    1. Attach the AmazonWorkSpacesAdmin policy by running the `aws iam attach-role-policy` command
    ```
    aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonWorkSpacesAdmin --role-name ```
